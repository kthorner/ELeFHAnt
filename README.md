# ELeFHAnt
Ensemble Learning for Harmonization and Annotation of Single Cells (ELeFHAnt) provides an easy to use R package for users to annotate clusters of single cells, harmonize labels across single cell datasets to generate a unified atlas and infer relationship among celltypes between two datasets. It provides users with the flexibility of choosing a single machine learning based classifier or letting ELeFHAnt automatically use the power of  randomForest and SVM (Support Vector Machines) to make predictions. It has three functions 1) CelltypeAnnotation 2) LabelHarmonization 3) DeduceRelationship.

## Version 1.1 is now available
1) Bugs are now brushed out
2) A new function to infer relationships among celltypes between scRNA datasets is added [DeduceRelationship]
3) ValidatePrections is now updated and runs a gene set enrichment analysis to check the enrichment of markers from assigned celltypes with respect to markers of seurat_clusters
4) randomForest now builds 1000 trees to train and classify
5) Increased cache memory in SVM
6) cost parameter of SVM is now set to 10

## ELeFHAnt Model
![Graph](ELeFHAnt.png)

## Random Forest
Random Forests is a powerful tool used extensively across a multitude of fields. It is based on generating a large number of decision trees, each constructed using a different subset of your training set. These subsets are usually selected by sampling at random and with replacement from the original data set. The decision trees are then used to identify a classification consensus by selecting the most common output.

## SVM (Support Vector Machines)
SVM is a well-established supervised machine learning algorithm. It finds a hyperplane that separates data points into classes, where training occurs through “maximizing the margin”. Training time tends to be longer as data increases. SVM was ranked highly for cell annotation when benchmarked against other tools.

## Ensemble Learning
ELeFHAnt provides users the ability to use ensemble learning for classifying celltypes for un-annotated datasets. In this mode ELeFHAnt uses the classification accuracy of both Random forest and SVM. It does so by assigning weights (accuracy while learning) to the predictions from each classifier. Weighted confusion matrices from each classifier are normalized based on highest number of cells shared among celltypes and assigned clusters, which are then added together to make the final ensemble predictions.

## Celltype Annotation Function
Celltype annotation is a function used to annotate celltypes in single cell datasets. It requires a reference dataset (a processed Seurat Object with Celltypes column in metadata) and a query dataset (a processed seurat object with seurat_clusters column in metadata). One can choose from randomForest, SVM or Ensemble classifiction methods to learn celltypes from the reference dataset and then predict celltypes for query dataset.

## Label Harmonization Function
Label Harmonization is a function used to harmonize cell labels (celltypes) across single cell datasets. It requires a list of processed Seurat Objects with a Celltypes column in metadata or an integrated seurat object (seurat object with Celltypes and seurat_clusters columns in the metadata). One can choose from randomForest, SVM or Ensemble classifiction methods.

## Deduce Relationship Function
Deduce Relationship is a function used to infer the similarity between celltypes across single cell datasets. The output is a heatmap that shows which celltype in one reference best corresponds to a celltype in another reference. It requires two reference datasets (both processed Seurat Objects with Celltypes columns in the metadata). One can choose from randomForest, SVM or Ensemble classifiction methods.

# Celltype Annotation in detail
Celltype annotation is a function to annotate celltypes in single cell datasets.

## Requirements
It requires a reference dataset (a processed Seurat Object with Celltypes column in the metadata) and a query dataset (a processed Seurat object with seurat_clusters column in the metadata). One can choose from randomForest, SVM or Ensemble classifiction methods to learn celltypes from the reference dataset and then predict celltypes for the query dataset.

## How does the function work?
### Merge Reference and Query
Merge reference and query into a Seurat object.
### Normalization
Run Log2 Normalization on the merged object using NormalizeData function in Seurat.
### Feature Selection
Obtain highly variable features from the merged data using FindVariableFeatures function in Seurat (default: 2000).
### Scaling
Scale the merged object for highly variable features using ScaleData function in Seurat.
### Generate train and test data
Training set is the reference data with celltypes extracted from scaled data. Test set is the query data with seurat_clusters extracted from scaled data.
### Train Classifiers
Training data is used for training randomForest and SVM classifiers.
### Predict Celltypes
Each classifier after training is then used to classify celltypes for the test data.
### Ensemble Learning
Ensemble learning based classsification uses both randomForest and SVM predictions to define final predictions. It does that by assigning weights (the accuracy while learning) to the predictions from each classifier. Weighted confusion matrices from each classifier are normalized based on highest number of cells shared among celltypes and assigned clusters, which are then added together to make the final ensemble predictions.

# Celltype Annotation Example
## Example1
To demonstrate  Celltype Annotation: reference was set to ForegutEnoderm mouse from E8.5 to E9.5 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17968-x) and query was set to foregut endoderm cells from E10.5 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/55526). No downsampling was performed.

### Predicted celltypes for query using Ensemble learning
![Graph](Examples/CelltypeAnnotation_Example.png)

We were successful at automating annotating celltypes in dataset coming from a later stage. Below is the celltype annotation from publication https://elifesciences.org/articles/55526

![Graph](Examples/OriginalLabels.png)

We see great consensus in celltype annotation.

## Example2
To further demostrate Celltype Annotation using ELeFHAnt we used Gut Cell Atlas(https://cellgeni.cog.sanger.ac.uk/gutcellatlas/fetal_RAWCOUNTS_cellxgene.h5ad) as the reference and Fetal intestinal data (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421005316) from Dr. Spence's Lab as the query. Reference and query were downsampled to 200 cells per Celltype and seurat_clusters respectively for enabling fast computation.

### GutCell data as Reference

### Fetal Intestine (Dr. Spence's Lab) as Query
![Graph](Examples/FetalIntestine_SpenceLab_Query.png)

### Predicted celltypes for query using Ensemble learning
![Graph](Examples/CelltypeAnnotation_Example2.png)


# Label Harmonization Example
To demonstrate LabelHarmonization we used three datasets: 1) Gut Cell Atlas(https://cellgeni.cog.sanger.ac.uk/gutcellatlas/fetal_RAWCOUNTS_cellxgene.h5ad) 2) Fetal intestinal data (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421005316) from Dr. Spence's Lab 3) Fetal intestine data from STAR-FINDer (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742031686X). Data shown below is based on subsetting 200 cells per celltype in each dataset to harmonize atlas consisting of ~125k cells.

### Harmonized Atlas ~125k cells
![Graph](Examples/HarmonizationExample_ELeFHAnt.png)

We can clearly see that after integration showing Celltypes from each dataset on UMAP is very difficult to interpret. Whereas using LabelHarmonization from ELeFHAnt each cluster after integration has a clear celltype assignment, making interpretation much clearer.

# Deduce Relationship Example
To demonstrate Deduce Relationship we used two datasets that were also uses in the harmonization example: 1) Gut Cell Atlas(https://cellgeni.cog.sanger.ac.uk/gutcellatlas/fetal_RAWCOUNTS_cellxgene.h5ad) 2) Fetal intestinal data (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421005316) from Dr. Spence's Lab. Data shown below is based on subsetting to 500 cells per celltype in each dataset.

### Relationship among celltypes between two datasets
![Graph](Examples/DeduceRelationship_Example.png)

The output of Deduce Relationship is a representation of the confusion matrix as a heatmap, with each square signifying how many cells of a given celltype in one reference were classified as a celltype in the other. It is normalized in such a way that each celltype in reference 2 has a red square that shows the most closely related celltype in reference 1. We see that the related celltypes all make biological sense, such as all immune cells being assigned to "Immune cells", and the mesenchyme subtypes being assigned to "Mesoderm 2".


# Reproducibility
To assess reproducibility, each function was run 5 times with varying numbers of cells used during subsampling, ranging from 100 to 500. This will also determine what number of examples during training leads to the best performance for the SVM and Random Forest classifers.

For Celltype Annotation, the predicted cell labels assigned to the query differ for 100 cells but remain stable when 200 to 500 cells are subsampled.
The following datasets were used: Gut Cell Atlas(https://cellgeni.cog.sanger.ac.uk/gutcellatlas/fetal_RAWCOUNTS_cellxgene.h5ad) as reference and Fetal intestinal data (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421005316) from Dr. Spence's Lab as query.

### Celltype Predictions using 100, 300 and 500 cells per Celltypes resepctively
![Graph](Examples/annotation_reproduce.png)

For Label Harmonization, we find that cell labels remain approximately 80% consistent across the different iterations. Relative to annotation, the complexity from the number of datasets and cell labels suggests that harmonization does benefit from a greater number of cells used. The following datasets were used: 1) Gut Cell Atlas(https://cellgeni.cog.sanger.ac.uk/gutcellatlas/fetal_RAWCOUNTS_cellxgene.h5ad) 2) Fetal intestinal data (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421005316) from Dr. Spence's Lab 3) Fetal intestine data from STAR-FINDer (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742031686X)

### Celltype harmonization using 100, 300 and 500 cells per Celltypes respectively
![Graph](Examples/harmonization_reproduce.png)

Lastly, for Deduce Relationship, the heatmaps display little variability even between subsamples of 100 and 500. The following datasets were used: Gut Cell Atlas(https://cellgeni.cog.sanger.ac.uk/gutcellatlas/fetal_RAWCOUNTS_cellxgene.h5ad) as reference1 and Fetal intestinal data (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421005316) from Dr. Spence's Lab as reference2.
